# About Nemesis
C&C Nemesis takes place after the Allied campaign of RA2, where the Soviets manage to free the Premier and stop Yuri's forces.  
Nemesis Devs plan to have 4 parts, having two acts for 4 campaigns each.  
The timelines may expand in future DLCs.  
  
Do note: the Nemesis Client does not include YR. It only has the modded files.  
To play YR through my launcher, please copy:  
All movie mixes (movies01, movies02, moviesmd03),  
RA2.mix,  
and RA2MD.mix.  
  
Please check renderer settings in menu before proceeding.
